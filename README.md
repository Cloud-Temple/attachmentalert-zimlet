Configurable Attachment Alert
==========

This Zimlet alerts you when sending a message if no attachment exists. 

The Zimlet will search for keywords in your message (for example, "attach" or "attachment"). 

And if the keywords exist in your outgoing message, the Zimlet will confirm that at least
one attachment exists before sending. If no attachments exist, an alert dialog is presented.

This is a fork from:
https://github.com/Zimbra-Community/adopted/tree/master/tk_barrydegraaff_attachmentalert


This version allows you to optionally configure the keywords to look for in
your email message. This way you can write emails in various languages and
still be able to get the attachment alert.
